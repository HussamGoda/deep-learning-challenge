# deep-learning-challenge

The repo "deep-learning-challenge" is created to address the requirements of Module 21 challenge (Unsupervised Learning).


Inside the repo, there two folders; "Starter_Code" and "Deep_Learning".


	- Folder "Starter_Code" contains only original code delivered as part of the assignment.


	- Folder "Deep_Learning" contains the following
		1- Starter_Code.ipynb: this file contains data pre-processing and different attempt to come up with best model possible
		2- AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation.ipynb: this contains data pre-processing and the best model achieved
		3- AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation.h5: model exported as .h5 format
		4- Neural_Network_Report.docx and Neural_Network_Report.pdf: Final report as requested in the assignment in word and pdf format.


Due to work business travel commitments, I was not able to commit any further time to come up with better outcome. As indicated in the instructions, three (+1) attempts are designed but, accuracy of 0.75 or higher was not achieved.
